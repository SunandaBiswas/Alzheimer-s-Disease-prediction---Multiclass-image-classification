# Alzheimer-s-Disease-prediction-by-image-classification
This is a multiclass image classififcation problem. Here, to classify four types of disease different image classification models has been implemented.

The dataset has been collected from Kaggle that contains 6400 images with 4 classes of Brain images (mild demented, moderate demented, non-demented, very mild demented stages). Initially, trained the data with the Sequential CNN model in augmented images. Therefore, implemented transfer learning-based pre-trained model Restnet152v2 along with extra layers of Conv2D and dropout, pooling layers for multiclass image classification.
